# COMP20 Assignment 2: Closest MBTA Station
# 20 October 2016

########## Completion ##########
To the best of my knowledge, all aspects of the assignment have been correctly
implemented. Files index.html, style.css, script_mbta.js, and relevant images
are all present. The map, markers, and polylines all display properly. When the
stations are clicked, it shows their schedules. When your location is clicled,
it shows the distance to the nearest station.

########## Collaboration ##########
