########## Completion ##########
To the best of my knowledge, all aspects of the assignment have been correctly
implemented. Files index.html and style.css are present, and text entries are
loaded into the div properly using jQuery. Note that there is a small added
feature: enter "--clear-log" to delete all entries in the log from the local
storage.

########## Collaboration ##########
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment, nor did I discuss it.

########## Duration ##########
I spent about three hours on this assignment.
