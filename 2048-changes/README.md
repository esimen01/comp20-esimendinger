# COMP20 Assignment 3: 2048 Game Center
# 17 November 2016

########## Completion ##########
To the best of my knowledge, all aspects of the assignment have been correctly
implemented. Files index.js, package.json, and Procfile are all present, as 
well as the modified files from the original 2048 game, game_manager.html and 
index.html. Scores are sent to the server through a post method (/submit.
json), and scores can be retrieved through a get method (/scores.json). The 
latter allows for a particular username to be entered in the URL as a query 
string (e.g., /scores.json?username=esimen01). The main page of the app lists 
all the scores in the database in descending order, along with their 
corresponding usernames and submission dates. The URL for the app is:
https://aqueous-beyond-90325.herokuapp.com
